# Workbench
A collection of small projects I've made to test out ideas or prototype a system.

WpfWindowProcedureHook:
This is a simple project that hooks into the window procedure of a WPF window and lets you react to the messages there. Also one example of doing a registration for more advanced windows messages. In this case for USB notifications.

Have fun!
